# Quant finance portfolio

This repository showcases my work in **quantitative finance**, applying numerical methods and simulations.  
It demonstrates my ability to **model stochastic processes**, **implement algorithms from scratch**, and **analyze convergence and error** - skills directly relevant to quantitative research and trading.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Highlights

### 1. Option Pricing Methods (Binomial Trees, Monte Carlo, Blackâ€“Scholes)

- Implemented and compared three core approaches to option pricing:
  - **Binomial trees** (American vs. European calls/puts, convergence to Blackâ€“Scholes).
  - **Blackâ€“Scholes benchmarks** (closed-form solutions, butterfly spread payoff).
  - **Monte Carlo simulation** (GBM under risk-neutral measure, confidence intervals, error scaling).
- Analyzed sensitivities to strike, maturity, and volatility, highlighting convergence and early exercise effects.
  
ðŸ‘‰ Skills: stochastic simulation, numerical methods, analytical finance, error analysis, visualization.

### 2. Volatility Estimation (Historical, Rolling, EWMA)

- Implemented and compared multiple approaches to volatility estimation:
  - **Historical volatility** (using log returns, annualization).
  - **Rolling window estimates** (sliding windows to track changing variance).
  - **Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (EWMA)** (linking half-life to decay factor Î»).
- Visualized and compared methods across different time periods, highlighting responsiveness to market shocks and the trade-off between smoothness and reactivity.

ðŸ‘‰ Skills: time-series modeling, statistical finance, stochastic processes, data visualization.
