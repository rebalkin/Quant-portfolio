# Quant finance portfolio

This repository showcases my work in **quantitative finance**, applying numerical methods and simulations.  
It demonstrates my ability to **model stochastic processes**, **implement algorithms from scratch**, and **analyze convergence and error** - skills directly relevant to quantitative research and trading.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Highlights

### 1. Binomial Tree Pricing
- American vs. European call and put options.  
- Pricing as a function of strike and volatility.  
- Demonstrated convergence of binomial estimates to the Blackâ€“Scholes formula.  

ðŸ‘‰ *Skills: algorithm implementation, numerical convergence, visualization.*

### 2. Blackâ€“Scholes Benchmarks
- Implemented closed-form call/put option formulas.  
- Compared analytic solutions with discrete binomial approximations.  
- Modeled complex payoffs like the **butterfly spread**.  

ðŸ‘‰ *Skills: mathematical finance, model validation, payoff engineering.*

---

### 3. Monte Carlo Simulation
- Simulated stock paths using **GBM under the risk-neutral measure**.  
- Estimated European option prices by averaging discounted payoffs.  
- Added **statistical rigor** with confidence intervals and error scaling (\(1/\sqrt{N}\)).  

ðŸ‘‰ *Skills: stochastic simulation, variance reduction, statistical analysis.*
